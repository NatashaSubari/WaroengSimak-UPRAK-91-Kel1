                        <span class="dropcap">I</span>ntegrated Learning Project is a mandatory activity and a graduation requirement for all 9th-grade students at Saint Ursula Junior High School in the 2024/2025 academic year. This learning method involves the collaboration of nine different subjects and is implemented across grades VII, VIII, and IX. For 9th-grade students, the project took the form of organizing a bazaar that required collaboration across all subjects.
                    </p>
                    <p class="abstract">
                        &emsp;&emsp;<mark>The bazaar was held on January 14th, 2025, and January 16th, 2025</mark>, offering students an opportunity to try their hands in business and entrepreneurship. 
                        <mark>Through this activity, various skills were developed</mark>, such as advertising, product selection, pricing strategies, booth design, profit calculation, and financial reporting. 
                        <mark>Additionally, in order to create environmentally friendly products, some biotechnology-coded innovations were carried out by the students.</mark>
                    </p>
                    <p class="abstract">
                        &emsp;&emsp;Our team, Waroeng SiMak, participated in the bazaar by selling various foods and crafts such as churros, pop ice, phone straps, polaroid pictures, stickers, keychains, and many more. 
                        <mark>These lineups of products were not randomly picked; rather, before finalizing our product choices, student preferences were observed to ensure that our goods would entice a wide range of buyers.</mark> 
                        <mark>Social media platforms such as Instagram were used to promote our products, maximizing outreach and engagement.</mark> 
                        <mark>Two purchasing methods were implemented to facilitate sales: on-the-spot buying at the bazaar and pre-ordering through a Google Form.</mark>
                    </p>
                    <p class="abstract">
                        &emsp;&emsp;The bazaar turned out to be a valuable learning experience for our team. 
                        <mark>Multiple insights into effective business strategies, customer interaction, and financial management were gained.</mark> 
                        Of course, a task this size did come with its challenges.
                    </p>

                <div class="columnbagi22">
                    <p class="abstract"><mark>One notable challenge was during our biotechnology project, where an attempt was made to create lip balm out of fermented honey.</mark> 
                        Unfortunately, the lip balm didn’t mix well because the measurements were inaccurate, the equipment was not precise or efficient, and boiling water accidentally got into the mixture, causing the oil to separate from the other ingredients. 
                        Despite facing these challenges, <mark>perseverance and teamwork were able to be applied to overcome them.</mark> 
                        From this experience, an important lesson was learned—the importance of never giving up, sticking to the correct process, and continuously experimenting to improve and refine until we achieve the desired results.
                    </p>
                    <p class="abstract">
                        &emsp;&emsp;Beyond business and entrepreneurship, <mark>this event was a perfect opportunity for social interaction and teamwork to be fostered.</mark> 
                        As an event where buyers and sellers meet to engage in transactions, the bazaar created an exciting and lively marketplace atmosphere. 
                        <mark>Buyers were allowed to explore various products, while sellers were given a chance to showcase their items and offer promotions.</mark> 
                        This direct interaction not only built trust but also influenced purchasing decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="abstract">
                        &emsp;&emsp;Furthermore, <mark>bazaars have also been known for their contribution to enhancing social interaction as they gather individuals from different backgrounds and ages.</mark> 
                        <mark>This was achieved through the meeting of rare products and the new social lines formed at the event.</mark> 
                        For us, this experience was very much a collaborative one, demonstrating the Serviam character value of “Team Unity Spirit.”
                        <mark>It was realized that through teamwork, difficulties and hardships could be faced, and success could be achieved and celebrated together as one.</mark>
                    </p>
                    <p class="abstract">
                        &emsp;&emsp;Overall, the Integrated Learning Project was a valuable experience. 
                        <mark>Theory was applied to a real-life situation, and problem-solving, creativity, and resilience were improved.</mark> 
                        <mark>Through the process, it was learned that it is possible to solve problems with persistence, teamwork, and receptiveness to learning from mistakes.</mark>
